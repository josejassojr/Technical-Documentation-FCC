      Hi! This page is dedicated to demonstrating some of my favorite computer science algorithms that I have come across during my time. If you study computer science then I'm sure you have seen most of these. I've picked these as my favorite for their popularity, significance, and just how fascinating they are! I'm hoping to add on to this page in the future so that it can be filled with tens of cool algorithms that I and anyone who comes across this page can look back on. Enjoy!

      Merge sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that produces a stable sort, which means that if two elements have the same value, they hold the same relative position in the sorted sequence as they did in the input. In other words, the relative order of elements with equal values is preserved in the sorted sequence. Merge sort is a comparison sort, which means that it can sort any input for which a less-than relation is defined.
    </p>   
    <p>
      Merge sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. Like all divide-and-conquer algorithms, merge sort divides a large array into two smaller subarrays and then recursively sort the subarrays. Basically, two steps are involved in the whole process:
    </p>
    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>
        Divide the unsorted array into n subarrays, each of size 1 (an array of size 1 is considered sorted).
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeatedly merge subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until only 1 subarray is left, which would be our sorted array.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <code class="code">
      # Merge two sorted sublists `A[low … mid]` and `A[mid+1 … high]`
def merge(A, aux, low, mid, high):
 
    k = low

      Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is often used for traversing/searching a tree/graph data structure. It starts at the root (in the case of a tree) or some arbitrary node (in the case of a graph) and explores all its neighbors, followed by the next-level neighbors, and so on.

    </header>
    <p>
      Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. Kruskal's Algorithm works by fiinding a subset of the edges from the given graph covering every vertext present in the graph such that they form a tree (called MST), and the sum of weights of edges is as minimum as possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <code> G = (V,E) </code> be the given graph. Initially, our MST contains only vertices of the given graph with no edges. In other words, initially, MST has <code>V</code> connected components, with each vertext acting as one connected componnent. The goal is to add minimum weight edges to our MST such that we are left with a single connected component that comprises all the graph's vertices. Following is the complete algorithm.
    </p>
    <code class="code">
      sort all edges in graph G in order of their increasing weights;
repeat V-1 times    // as MST contains V-1 edges
{
    select the next edge with minimum weight from graph G;
 
    if (no cycle is formed by adding the edge in MST, i.e., the edge connects two
            different connected components in MST)
        add the edge to MST;

      The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.[1] It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.

    <p>
      Euclid's algorithm is a method for efficiently finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD of two integers, <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, is the largest number that divides both <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> without leaving a remainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.
    </p>
    <p>For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 <code>(252 = 21 × 12 and 105 = 21 × 5)</code>, and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and 147 <code>(147 = 252 - 105)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal. When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.
    </p>
    <code class="code">
      #include <stdio.h>
 
// Recursive function to calculate gcd of two numbers
// using Euclid’s algorithm
int euclid(int a, int b)
{
    // if the remainder is 0, return the second number
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    }
 
    int q = a / b;      // quotient
    int r = a - q * b;  // remainder
 
    // or we can simply use `a % b` to calculate `r`
 
    // `a` becomes `b` and `b` becomes `r` (`a % b`)
    return euclid(b, r);
}
 
int main()
{
    int a = 2740;
    int b = 1760;
 
    printf("Euclid(%d, %d) = %d", a, b, euclid(a, b));
 
    return 0;
}

Output:

Euclid(2740, 1760) = 20
